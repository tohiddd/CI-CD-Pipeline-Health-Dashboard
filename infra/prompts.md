# AI Interaction Log - Terraform Infrastructure Setup

This document logs all AI interactions and prompts used during the generation of the Terraform infrastructure scripts for the CI/CD Pipeline Health Dashboard.

## Session Information
- **Date**: October 2, 2025
- **AI Assistant**: Claude Sonnet 4
- **Project**: CI/CD Pipeline Health Dashboard
- **Task**: Create complete Terraform infrastructure for AWS deployment

## Initial User Request

### User Prompt:
```
I need to use Terraform to deploy my containerized CI/CD Pipeline Health Dashboard application (Added the reference) to the cloud. Here are the requirements:

Provision a VM/Compute instance (AWS EC2 preferred, but GCP/Azure are viable options).
Networking basics: Create a VPC, public subnet, internet gateway, and a security group.
Allow SSH (port 22) and HTTP access (port 80).
Provision a managed database (optional, only if the app requires it) on AWS (e.g., RDS/Postgres).
Include input variables for DB credentials, DB name, and DB engine.
Ensure connectivity between the database and the VM through proper security group rules.
Deploy my Dockerized app on the VM.
Install Docker using user_data during the VM setup.
Pull the Docker image containing my CI/CD Pipeline Health Dashboard from Docker Hub.
Run the container and expose the app publicly (via port 80).
Output the public IP or URL of the app that users can access once deployment is successful.
Documentation:
Provide inline comments in the Terraform scripts for clarity.
Write a step-by-step deployment guide (deployment.md) with instructions for running this Terraform setup.
Create a log (prompts.md) of all AI interactions/prompts used while generating these scripts and documentation.
Generate all Terraform scripts (main.tf, variables.tf, and outputs.tf) and update documentation for everything above in one go. Ensure the directory structure and deliverables match the requirements. Add cleanup instructions to destroy the provisioned infrastructure when no longer needed."* puts everting in infra folder,do not hampper other files and folder in that repo
```

## AI Analysis and Planning

### Initial Analysis:
The AI assistant analyzed the existing application structure by examining:
1. `docker-compose.yml` - Identified multi-service architecture (PostgreSQL, Redis, Backend, Frontend)
2. `backend/package.json` - Confirmed Node.js backend with specific dependencies
3. `database/init.sql` - Understood database schema requirements
4. `backend/Dockerfile` and `frontend/Dockerfile` - Analyzed containerization setup

### Key Findings:
- Application uses PostgreSQL database (required)
- Redis cache is needed
- Backend runs on port 3001
- Frontend runs on port 3000
- Multi-container architecture with health checks
- Environment variables for external integrations (GitHub, Jenkins, SMTP)

## Task Breakdown and Implementation

### Task Planning:
The AI created a structured task list:
1. Examine application structure ✅
2. Create infra folder structure ✅
3. Create variables.tf with comprehensive input variables ✅
4. Create outputs.tf with all necessary outputs ✅
